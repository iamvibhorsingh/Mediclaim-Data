# Project on mediclaim dataset 

Made this for HackData 2 hackathon using a dataset obtained from johnsnow labs.

![correlation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22034866/36349638-f09e7934-14b0-11e8-9e0d-4551d1f9d623.png)

The dataset's features don't show a lot of correlation even after cleaning the dataset thoroughly so it wasn't a surprise that we found it hard to automate which claims are *clearly* false but we did have some success.
